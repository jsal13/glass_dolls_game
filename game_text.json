        "In the realm of Luminae, a forgotten artistry thrives --- the creation of glass dolls imbued with enchanted souls. These delicate beings, crafted by skilled artisans, possess a life force akin to that of humans, yet they are bound by the fragility of their glass forms.",
        "The Vengeful Spirit, bound to a shattered glass doll, seeks revenge on those who wronged them in life by manipulating other dolls to do their bidding.  After installing the Empress Lilith, a cruel tyrant corrupted by the Vengeful Spirit, in the city of Opaline Reach, tensions rise between neighboring cities and the fate of Luminae hangs in the balance.",
        "Amidst this turmoil, you and three other scholars have been summoned to the neighboring city of Shimmerstone to infiltrate Opaline Reach and do battle with the Empress Lilith.",
        "Good luck."
