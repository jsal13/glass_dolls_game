MY FATHER AND THE REST OF THE FAMILY BEING OBLIGED TO ATTEND AS WITNESSES, I ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE COURT. DURING THE WHOLE OF THIS WRETCHED MOCKERY OF JUSTICE I SUFFERED LIVING TORTURE. IT WAS TO BE DECIDED WHETHER THE RESULT OF MY CURIOSITY AND LAWLESS DEVICES WOULD CAUSE THE DEATH OF TWO OF MY FELLOW BEINGS: ONE A SMILING BABE FULL OF INNOCENCE AND JOY, THE OTHER FAR MORE DREADFULLY MURDERED, WITH EVERY AGGRAVATION OF INFAMY THAT COULD MAKE THE MURDER MEMORABLE IN HORROR. JUSTINE ALSO WAS A GIRL OF MERIT AND POSSESSED QUALITIES WHICH PROMISED TO RENDER HER LIFE HAPPY; NOW ALL WAS TO BE OBLITERATED IN AN IGNOMINIOUS GRAVE, AND I THE CAUSE! A THOUSAND TIMES RATHER WOULD I HAVE CONFESSED MYSELF GUILTY OF THE CRIME ASCRIBED TO JUSTINE, BUT I WAS ABSENT WHEN IT WAS COMMITTED, AND SUCH A DECLARATION WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS THE RAVINGS OF A MADMAN AND WOULD NOT HAVE EXCULPATED HER WHO SUFFERED THROUGH ME. THE APPEARANCE OF JUSTINE WAS CALM. SHE WAS DRESSED IN MOURNING, AND HER COUNTENANCE, ALWAYS ENGAGING, WAS RENDERED, BY THE SOLEMNITY OF HER FEELINGS, EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL. YET SHE APPEARED CONFIDENT IN INNOCENCE AND DID NOT TREMBLE, ALTHOUGH GAZED ON AND EXECRATED BY THOUSANDS, FOR ALL THE KINDNESS WHICH HER BEAUTY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE EXCITED WAS OBLITERATED IN THE MINDS OF THE SPECTATORS BY THE IMAGINATION OF THE ENORMITY SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE COMMITTED. SHE WAS TRANQUIL, YET HER TRANQUILLITY WAS EVIDENTLY CONSTRAINED; AND AS HER CONFUSION HAD BEFORE BEEN ADDUCED AS A PROOF OF HER GUILT, SHE WORKED UP HER MIND TO AN APPEARANCE OF COURAGE. WHEN SHE ENTERED THE COURT SHE THREW HER EYES ROUND IT AND QUICKLY DISCOVERED WHERE WE WERE SEATED. A TEAR SEEMED TO DIM HER EYE WHEN SHE SAW US, BUT SHE QUICKLY RECOVERED HERSELF, AND A LOOK OF SORROWFUL AFFECTION SEEMED TO ATTEST HER UTTER GUILTLESSNESS.\", \"A MURMUR OF APPROBATION FOLLOWED ELIZABETH'S SIMPLE AND POWERFUL APPEAL, BUT IT WAS EXCITED BY HER GENEROUS INTERFERENCE, AND NOT IN FAVOUR OF POOR JUSTINE, ON WHOM THE PUBLIC INDIGNATION WAS TURNED WITH RENEWED VIOLENCE, CHARGING HER WITH THE BLACKEST INGRATITUDE. SHE HERSELF WEPT AS ELIZABETH SPOKE, BUT SHE DID NOT ANSWER. MY OWN AGITATION AND ANGUISH WAS EXTREME DURING THE WHOLE TRIAL. I BELIEVED IN HER INNOCENCE; I KNEW IT. COULD THE DÆMON WHO HAD (I DID NOT FOR A MINUTE DOUBT) MURDERED MY BROTHER ALSO IN HIS HELLISH SPORT HAVE BETRAYED THE INNOCENT TO DEATH AND IGNOMINY? I COULD NOT SUSTAIN THE HORROR OF MY SITUATION, AND WHEN I PERCEIVED THAT THE POPULAR VOICE AND THE COUNTENANCES OF THE JUDGES HAD ALREADY CONDEMNED MY UNHAPPY VICTIM, I RUSHED OUT OF THE COURT IN AGONY. THE TORTURES OF THE ACCUSED DID NOT EQUAL MINE; SHE WAS SUSTAINED BY INNOCENCE, BUT THE FANGS OF REMORSE TORE MY BOSOM AND WOULD NOT FORGO THEIR HOLD. I PASSED A NIGHT OF UNMINGLED WRETCHEDNESS. IN THE MORNING I WENT TO THE COURT; MY LIPS AND THROAT WERE PARCHED. I DARED NOT ASK THE FATAL QUESTION, BUT I WAS KNOWN, AND THE OFFICER GUESSED THE CAUSE OF MY VISIT. THE BALLOTS HAD BEEN THROWN; THEY WERE ALL BLACK, AND JUSTINE WAS CONDEMNED.\", 'FAR FROM BEING SUBDUED BY THIS INFORMAL USAGE, MY INDIGNATION TRIUMPHED OVER THAT SLAVISH AWE WHICH HAD HITHERTO ENFORCED MY OBEDIENCE; AND THE MORE MY YEARS AND KNOWLEDGE INCREASED, THE MORE I PERCEIVED THE INJUSTICE AND BARBARITY OF HIS BEHAVIOUR. BY THE HELP OF AN UNCOMMON GENIUS, AND THE ADVICE AND DIRECTION OF OUR USHER, WHO HAD SERVED MY FATHER IN HIS TRAVELS, I MADE A SURPRISING PROGRESS IN THE CLASSICS, WRITING, AND ARITHMETIC; SO THAT, BEFORE I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD, I WAS ALLOWED BY EVERYBODY TO BE THE BEST SCHOLAR IN THE SCHOOL. THIS QUALIFICATION, TOGETHER WITH THE BOLDNESS OF TEMPER AND STRENGTH OF MAKE WHICH HAD SUBJECTED ALMOST ALL MY CONTEMPORARIES, GAVE ME SUCH INFLUENCE OVER THEM THAT I BEGAN TO FORM CABALS AGAINST MY PERSECUTOR; AND WAS IN HOPE OF, BEING ABLE TO BID HIM DEFIANCE IN A VERY SHORT TIME. BEING AT THE HEAD OF A FACTION, CONSISTING OF THIRTY BOYS, MOST OF THEM OF MY OWN AGE, I WAS DETERMINED TO PUT THEIR METTLE TO TRIAL, THAT I MIGHT KNOW HOW FAR THEY WERE TO BE DEPENDED UPON, BEFORE I PUT MY GRAND SCHEME IN EXECUTION: WITH THIS VIEW, WE ATTACKED A BODY OF STOUT APPRENTICES, WHO HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF A PART OF THE GROUND ALLOTTED TO US FOR THE SCHEME OF OUR DIVERSIONS, AND WHO WERE THEN PLAYING AT NINEPINS ON THE SPOT; BUT I HAD THE MORTIFICATION TO SEE MY ADHERENTS ROUTED IN AN INSTANT, AND A LEG OF ONE OF THEM BROKE IN HIS FLIGHT BY THE BOWL, WHICH ONE OF OUR ADVERSARIES HAD DETACHED IN PURSUIT OF US. THIS DISCOMFITURE DID NOT HINDER US FROM ENGAGING THEM AFTERWARDS IN FREQUENT SKIRMISHES, WHICH WE MAINTAINED BY THROWING STONES AT A DISTANCE, WHEREIN I RECEIVED MANY WOUNDS, THE SCARS OF WHICH STILL REMAIN. OUR ENEMIES WERE SO HARASSED AND INTERRUPTED BY THESE ALARMS THAT THEY AT LAST ABANDONED THEIR CONQUEST, AND LEFT US TO THE PEACEABLE ENJOYMENT OF OUR OWN TERRITORIES.', 'YET BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THIS SLEEPY SOUTHERN TOWN LIES A TUMULT OF PASSIONS AND CONFLICTS, SIMMERING JUST OUT OF SIGHT LIKE THE MUDDY WATERS OF THE NEARBY YOKNAPATAWPHA RIVER. FAMILY FEUDS STRETCH BACK THROUGH THE ANNALS OF TIME, THEIR ORIGINS LOST TO MEMORY BUT THEIR CONSEQUENCES STILL FELT KEENLY BY THOSE WHO INHERIT THEIR BURDENS. LOVE AND LOSS, HOPE AND DESPAIR—THESE ARE THE THREADS THAT BIND THE INHABITANTS OF JEFFERSON TOGETHER, WEAVING A TAPESTRY OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE AS RICH AND COMPLEX AS THE FERTILE SOIL UPON WHICH THE TOWN WAS BUILT. AND SO, IN THE SHADOW OF THE PAST, THE PEOPLE OF JEFFERSON NAVIGATE THE TREACHEROUS WATERS OF FATE, EACH ONE GRAPPLING WITH THEIR OWN DEMONS AND DESIRES, EACH ONE SEEKING REDEMPTION IN A WORLD WHERE THE LINE BETWEEN SIN AND SALVATION IS AS THIN AS THE EDGE OF A RAZOR BLADE. FOR IN THIS PLACE, WHERE TIME STANDS STILL AND THE PAST CASTS A LONG SHADOW OVER THE PRESENT, THE ONLY CERTAINTY IS THE INEVITABILITY OF CHANGE, AS UNSTOPPABLE AND INEXORABLE AS THE MIGHTY RIVER THAT FLOWS THROUGH THE HEART OF THE TOWN.', 'YET BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THIS SEEMINGLY BANAL EXISTENCE LIES A WORLD OF HIDDEN ANXIETIES AND EXISTENTIAL DREAD, A WORLD WHERE THE SPECTER OF TERRORISM AND THE SPECTER OF CONSUMERISM LOOM LARGE IN THE COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS. FROM THE OMINOUS GLOW OF COMPUTER SCREENS TO THE RELENTLESS DRONE OF NEWS BROADCASTS, THE DENIZENS OF BELLPORT ARE BOMBARDED ON ALL SIDES BY A CACOPHONY OF NOISE AND INFORMATION, THEIR MINDS NUMBED BY THE CEASELESS ONSLAUGHT OF MEDIA SATURATION. AND SO, IN THE SHADOW OF AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE, THE RESIDENTS OF BELLPORT CARRY ON WITH THEIR LIVES, EACH ONE A TINY COG IN THE VAST MACHINERY OF MODERNITY, EACH ONE STRUGGLING TO FIND MEANING AND PURPOSE IN A WORLD THAT SEEMS INCREASINGLY DEVOID OF BOTH. FOR IN THIS DYSTOPIAN LANDSCAPE OF FRACTURED IDENTITIES AND FRACTURED REALITIES, THE ONLY CERTAINTY IS THE EVER-PRESENT SPECTER OF UNCERTAINTY, LURKING JUST BEYOND THE HORIZON LIKE A STORM CLOUD ON THE VERGE OF BREAKING.'], 'sub_cipher_translated_phrases': [\"YA WUOOAL U JAY OUL FNRZO RXVIB ABAGAX N'DBNDH, YFAX VFA VZIUB YUO VN DNSSAXDA.
